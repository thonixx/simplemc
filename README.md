This script is designed to just work with start/stop.  
Not more not less, just the basic things.

I like it when a script is as simple as possible and works as expected.  
Create issues on github.com/thonixx/simplemc if you want to request something.

You can rename the file to your needs and copy/symlink it to /etc/init.d/ for a "service"-script.  
Example: /etc/init.d/minecraft start  
Example 2: /etc/init.d/minecraft stop
